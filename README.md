# Bilhanah Public Web

React + TypeScript + Vite landing page with the Teal & Guava identity.

Part of Bilhanah, three repositories cloned side by side: [bilhanah-BE](https://github.com/mohamedelsayed29/bilhanah-BE) (API, shared packages, infrastructure), [bilhanah-client-FE](https://github.com/mohamedelsayed29/bilhanah-client-FE) (website) and [bilhanah-dashboard-FE](https://github.com/mohamedelsayed29/bilhanah-dashboard-FE) (dashboard). To run everything together, use `npm run dev` in bilhanah-BE; it starts this app too.

`packages/contracts` is a copy of the API's request/response schemas, owned by bilhanah-BE. Do not edit it here: change it in bilhanah-BE and run `npm run contracts:sync` there (see `packages/README.md`).

## Run locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL. Run commands from this directory.

## Validate and build

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

Browser tests use the installed Chrome channel and start/reuse a local Vite server (set `WEB_E2E_PORT` when 5173 is taken). Production files are emitted to `dist/`; `docker build` packages them with Caddy (see `Dockerfile` for the build arguments).

## Features

- Arabic/English page with persisted language preference and RTL/LTR layout.
- Three-scene live-action background video with pause/play, chapter selection, reduced-motion support, and poster fallback.
- Working illustrative restaurant menu, category filters, sizes, cart quantities, and explicitly simulated confirmation.
- Real QR linking to the sample menu, with clipboard support.
- Plans at EGP 200/350/500 per month, trial details, FAQ, and mobile navigation.
- Accessible native dialogs and honest registration-coming-soon messaging.

## Stand shop (frontend preview)

`/shop` provides an Arabic/English stand configurator and a frontend-only shopping flow. Choose Classic, Arch or Tilt, a destination (menu, Google reviews or a custom link), print style or custom background/text shades (a plus-button dialog with a hue/saturation wheel, light/dark slider, native color picker and HEX), brand/logo, optional table numbers and quantity.

Pricing is explicit: QR is included at EGP 350 per stand. An optional NFC chip adds EGP 100 per stand, so QR + NFC costs EGP 450. QR-only is selected by default. `unitPrice()` and `lineTotal()` in `src/features/stand-shop/catalog.ts` centralize pricing. The same option and itemized add-on charge follow each design through saved drafts, mixed carts, editing, quantities, checkout and the downloaded JSON v2 summary. Old drafts without an NFC field default to QR-only. Shipping is excluded.

The gallery has two modes: product imagery and interactive 3D. The former flat “Your live design” view has been removed. Product photos are illustrative; selected print colors, brand, uploaded logo, table number, real QR and the NFC/scan-only instruction update on the 3D model. The model supports 360° drag, pinch/buttons, keyboard arrows, +/− and Home. Three.js loads when needed; rendering pauses offscreen and when idle, reduced motion disables damping, and unavailable WebGL gets a photo fallback and retry. Geometry is illustrative rather than manufacturing CAD.

QR generation/download, logo handling and saved drafts run locally. Contact/delivery information remains in React memory and is included only in a user-downloaded sample summary. No payment details, real orders, backend writes or uploads are submitted. The plus sits beside the four presets. Apply commits a color choice; Cancel, Escape and backdrop dismissal leave the prior colors unchanged. Custom colors are validated, saved with drafts/cart items, and exported as the resolved print palette. QR remains dark on white. Background changes choose readable text automatically, with a manual text override and contrast correction. The exported summary includes base price, NFC surcharge, each item’s NFC selection/unit price/line total and the product total.

The header, footer and NFC landing section link to the shop. Run `npm run test:e2e -- tests/stand-shop.spec.ts tests/stand-3d.spec.ts tests/stand-colors.spec.ts tests/nfc-stands.spec.ts` to verify the full flow, optional-NFC pricing, responsive/accessibility behavior, local draft/logo/QR handling and 3D controls/fallback.

## Restaurant pages

On `{subdomain}.{VITE_ROOT_DOMAIN}` the app renders the restaurant's public page instead of the landing (`src/features/restaurant-menu`). It reads `GET /v1/public/restaurants/:subdomain` from `VITE_API_URL` and shows the restaurant's details, a neutral "temporarily unavailable" page for expired or suspended restaurants, or "restaurant not found". Locally, open `http://{subdomain}.localhost:5173`. The menu itself arrives in phase 2. Unless the visitor has chosen a language, the page uses the restaurant's default language.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`: `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_ROOT_DOMAIN` (production `bilhanah.com`) and `VITE_DASHBOARD_URL`.

## Important boundaries

Subscriptions, payments, and real orders are not connected yet. Account creation exists in the dashboard but is not deployed: while `VITE_DASHBOARD_URL` is empty, trial actions keep the "registration coming soon" notice and link to the sample. Setting it makes the trial dialog link to `{VITE_DASHBOARD_URL}/register`. The sample restaurant, dishes, and dish prices are illustrative. Ready alerts and vibration are described with device limitations.

## Where to edit

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/features/marketing/components` | Landing sections and sample menu |
| `src/features/marketing/data/plans.ts` | Initial prices and translated feature lists |
| `src/features/marketing/data/menu.ts` | Illustrative restaurant menu |
| `src/styles/global.css` | Brand tokens and page styles |
| `src/styles/hero.css` | Responsive header, original logo viewport, and hero composition |
| `public/brand` | Transparent vector logo and original raster source |
| `src/lib/language.tsx` | Language preference and formatting |
| `public/media` | Optimized photos and the background movie |
| `docs/ASSETS.md` | Image sources, exact generation prompts, and video provenance |

The hero MP4 is a 14.08-second edit of real Pexels footage with natural hand/phone motion. It does not animate still photographs. A reproducible local editing script and footage credits are documented in docs/ASSETS.md. Self-hosted fonts and all visual assets are served locally. The current static preview is configured in `.openai/hosting.json`.
